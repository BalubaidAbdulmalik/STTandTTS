# STT and TTS
here I made three files in watson-streaming-stt-tts folder:

1- transcribe.py which will convert speech to text by running the code or in terminal write *python transcribe.py -t 10* where 10 is the seconds.

2- TextToSpeech.py which will convert text to speech by writing the text file name in the code then running the program.

3- stt-tts.py file where I merge the two programs so first you need to record an audio then the program will convert it into text after that it will convert the text into speech (audio file).

* 1 and 2 is the first task
* 3 is the second task
